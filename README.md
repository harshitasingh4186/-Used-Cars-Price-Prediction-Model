# Used-Cars-Price-Prediction-Model
This project builds a Used Cars Price Prediction Model using machine learning techniques. It processes car data, and trains predictive models to estimate car prices based on various attributes like brand, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. The implementation is done in Python (Jupyter Notebook) with CSV data preprocessing.
<br>
<br>
🔍 Overview:
<br>
This project focuses on predicting the price of used cars using machine learning techniques. Given a dataset containing various features of used cars, we apply data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to develop an accurate price estimation system.
<br>
<br>

📂 Files Included:
<br>

📄 cars_data.csv – A dataset containing details of used cars, including attributes like brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more.
<br>
📜 Used Cars Price Prediction.ipynb – A Jupyter Notebook implementing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models for price prediction.
<br>
<br>
🛠 Project Workflow:
<br>
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing 🧹
<br>
Load and clean the dataset (handle missing values, duplicates, etc.).
Convert categorical features into numerical format using encoding techniques.
Feature scaling and transformation for better model performance.
<br>
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
<br>
Visualizing distributions of car prices, mileage, and other key factors.
Analyzing correlations between features and price using heatmaps and scatter plots.
<br>
3️⃣ Feature Engineering & Selection ⚙️
<br>
Identifying important attributes that influence price (e.g., age, mileage, fuel type).
Creating new derived features to improve model accuracy.
<br>
4️⃣ Model Selection & Training 🤖
<br>
Implementing regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Splitting data into training and testing sets to evaluate performance.
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy.
<br>
5️⃣ Model Evaluation & Prediction 📈
<br>
Measuring model performance using R² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Comparing different models to select the best-performing one.
<br>
<br>
🎯 Applications:
<br>
🚗 Used car dealerships – Help price cars accurately based on market trends.
<br>
📈 Personal car valuation – Estimate resale value before selling or buying a used car.
<br>
📊 Automobile industry insights – Analyze pricing patterns across different brands and features.
<br>
🧑‍💻 Machine learning practice – Ideal project for learning regression modeling and feature engineering.<br>
<br>
<br>
💡 Future Enhancements:
<br>
✅ Incorporating deep learning models for better predictions.
<br>
✅ Adding real-time web scraping for live market trends.
<br>
✅ Deploying as a web app for user-friendly car price estimation.
<br>

🚀 This project provides a practical application of data science and machine learning in real-world pricing predictions. Feel free to explore, modify, and improve the model!
