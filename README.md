# -Used-Cars-Price-Prediction-Model
This project builds a Used Cars Price Prediction Model using machine learning techniques. It processes car data, and trains predictive models to estimate car prices based on various attributes like brand, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. The implementation is done in Python (Jupyter Notebook) with CSV data preprocessing.
